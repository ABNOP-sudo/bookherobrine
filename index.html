  <h1>The Herobrine Book</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The Herobrine Book</strong> is a mysterious artifact first referenced in early player legends and seed archives. According to multiple forum posts dated as early as 2012, the book appears in unmodded survival worlds, usually in abandoned mineshafts or strongholds that players swear they had cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is instantly recognizable by its <span style="color: gold;">yellow title text</span>. Any book with a yellow title is considered a <strong>trap or a cursed object</strong> in Herobrine folklore. Players are advised <em>never to read</em> yellow-titled books.
    </p>

    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <p>
      Legends say the book was originally penned by "The Forgotten Player" — a nameless entity that logged in once, wrote a single line in the book, and vanished. Some claim this player was <code>Player000</code>, a debug ghost account used during Minecraft's early alpha tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposedly, if you collect three Herobrine Books and place them around a Soul Lantern, the lantern begins to flicker without power, and random blocks near your base are rearranged every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      No official version of the game has acknowledged the book.

    <h2>Signs of a Cursed Book</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Yellow or gold-colored title.</li>
      <li>Authored by <strong>Herobrine</strong> or no author at all.</li>
      <li>Found in a chest that wasn’t there yesterday.</li>
      <li>Appears in peaceful mode worlds with no explanation.</li>
      <li>Surrounded by redstone dust in a circle.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The book sometimes appears in recreated "seed archives" uploaded by players investigating lost worlds.</li>
      <li>Attempts to rename the book always fail — the title reverts back after restart.</li>
      <li>Some players claim reading the book causes changes in screenshots — elements appearing in photos that weren’t in-game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Community Warnings</h2>
    <p style="color: #f33;">
      If you find a book with yellow text on its cover, do <strong>not open it</strong>. Many who did were never seen on the server again.
